/**
 * @summary This function is used to add a new map to the database and link it to the required event.
 *
 * @description First, the name and description of the map are retrieved from the web page and the ID of the event for
 * which the map is to be added is retrieved from the URL. A JSON object is then created from the name and description of
 * the map and the 'addMap' function is called with the JSON object as a parameter. If the map is successfully added to
 * the database, the ID of the map created is retrieved from the response from the back-end and a new JSON object created with
 * the IDs of both the map and event to be linked. This JSON object is then taken as a parameter to the 'addEventMap'
 * method which is used to link together the map and the event. If the association was created successfully, the user is
 * redirected to the page of the event for which the map was added.
